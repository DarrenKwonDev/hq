## Research & Strategies Philosophy
Prioritize structural edge over statistical methods:
- **Preferred**: Rule-based arbitrage, exchange/protocol mechanics exploitation, risk-free opportunities
- **Examples**: CEX-DEX arb, fee structure arbitrage, timing advantages (morning edge, DMA), protocol inefficiencies
- **Avoid**: Pure mean reversion or mathematical prediction (unless clear edge exists)
- **Focus**: Market microstructure, regulatory advantages, execution infrastructure
